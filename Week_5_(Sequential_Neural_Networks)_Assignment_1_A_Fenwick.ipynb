        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, I will develop a neural net from scratch to illustrate the operations of the model (such as forward pass) and explain how neural networks optimize their prediction accuracy through a concept called backpropagation (Rumelhart et al., 1986a). This notebook is part of an assignment which explains the mathematics behind forward pass and backpropagation and aims to reflect how some of the equations are translated into code to allow the model to run effectively. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "A dataset has been provided by the examiner for use in this assignment to test the performance of the neural net. The dataset contains 1000 rows and 4 columns. 3 columns x variables which forms the input data for the model and 1 column which is the output variables Y which I aim to predict with the neural net. The Y variable consists of 0s and 1s, which means that the I will address a binary classification problem. Besides testing the dataset with the coded neural net, I will also us a logistic regression algorithm from sklearn to compare the results between both approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Forward Pass and Backpropagation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In machine learning, forward propagation (or forward pass) refers to the calculation and storage of intermediate variables (including outputs) for a neural network going from the input layer to the output layer. Backpropagation, on the other hand, computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input–output example. This is an important step in neural networks, as this is the way the algorithm learns to correct the weights and biases for its model. Backpropagation evaluates the expression for the derivative of the cost function (following the chain rule) as a product of derivatives between each layer from right to left with the gradient of the weights between each layer being a simple modification of the partial products. \n",

        "The design of the neural net in python, without using existing librabries like Keras and Tensorflow, was an interesting exercise. It helped to understand the math underlying forward pass, backpropagation, and gradient descent and how to code these various algoritms. Having a solid understanding of how the mechanics work of neural nets is crucial for model design and improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, the performance of a neural net was compared with that of a logistical regression algorithm from sklearn using a provided dataset. The model addressed a binary classification problem predicting either 0 or 1 in the output variable Y using three input columns X. Model accuracy and the loss function were measures of performance. Both models performed equally well showing 94.4% - 94.8% training accuracy and 95.0% validation accuracy. "

        "* This assignment was particularly challenging due to some initial lack in understanding of the derivative calculations. Nevertheless, a very learningful exercise to better understand how things work under the hood compared to using Keras and Tensorflow to design neural networks. This assignment has increased my appreciation for better understanding the math underlying the development of neural networks and the translation of these equations into code. \n",

        "* The neural net was representated in the current format. However, there are many other ways you can code a neural network. There is no perfect script. Parts of the neural net were inspired by creations of other developers and practice code from the book Python Machine Learning (Raschka, S. & Mirjalili, V., 2017). I will familiarize myself more in building neural nets from scratch in the coming months to be able to build such models more independently.\n",
